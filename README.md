# IntelliTect-Internship
Here are some of the things I've worked on over the years that I believe are pertinent.

1. Procedural Map Generator:
   Generates a map of connected rooms cell by cell using a dynamic list of viable neighboring cells to
   create a cohesive image.
2. Casesar Cipher:
   Takes in a string of text and shifts it along the alphabet to encrypt a message. Also able to
   decrypt encoded messages.
3. Linked List Class:
   A structure for organizing data based on nested "nodes" that contain data and references to their
   immediate neighboor. Contains methods for altering, reading, and displaying the list.
4. Pygame Test:
   Small project implementing the pygame package that involves a controllable cube, collision detection,
   and control over the parameters that define the physics.

6. Extras:
   There are several projects of mine that I no longer have access to or limited access to as they
   exist in software that was linked to my public school email which no longer exists. I would be
   happy to talk about them at length, however. These projects include an implementation of Conway's
   game of life in code.org's painter interface, an unbeatable tic-tac-toe bot, and a game where challenges
   adapted to the player to provide a consistent experience.
